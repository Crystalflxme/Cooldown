# Cooldown

Cooldown is a simple [Luau](https://luau-lang.org) class to manage cooldowns. Cooldown is my personal way of managing cooldowns for my projects. It avoids yielding altogether to provide performant results. On top of that, it uses a key based system for managing individual cooldowns, allowing you to create Cooldown instances for a single type of cooldown while managing individual subjects.

Full documentation with examples for this project can be found [on the documentation website](https://crystalflxme.github.io/docs/cooldown/).

## Important Note
Cooldown has been moved to the [Hexwork](https://github.com/Crystalflxme/Hexwork) repository. This version is no longer maintained.
